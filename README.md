# Home Bar Inventory

---

## Purpose:

While many applications exist to manage food and drink inventories for restaurants,
not many of these are available to the average household for free.
The goal for this project was to create a solution to this problem, in which a user
is able to store the inventory of drinks they may have at home and update it as things
are used up.

This project is at its core a Java API used to manage the inventory of an at home bar.
Completing this project will demonstrate my ability to create and use a REST API while 
following procedures and practices used by proper software engineers.
